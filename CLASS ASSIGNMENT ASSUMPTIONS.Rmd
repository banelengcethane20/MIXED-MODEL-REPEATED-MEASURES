## MIXED MODEL REPEATED MEASURES
## ASSUMPTIONS

1. LINEARITY  
->the dependent variable and fixed and random effects should be linear.  
2. NORMALITY  
->the residuals of the model should be normally distributed.  
3. HOMEOSCEDASTICITY  
->the variance of the residuals should be constant all levels of the fixed and random effects.  
4. SPHERICITY  
-> this assusmption is only relevant for repeated measures models with three or more levels of the within-subjects.  
->it state that the variance of the differences scores between any two levels of the within-subjects factors should be equal.  
5. Missing data at random  
-> the missings of the data should be independent of the unobserved values and should only depend on the observed values.
